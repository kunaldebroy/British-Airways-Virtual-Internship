# British-Airways-Virtual-Internship

Completed a data-driven simulation to highlight the role of data science in British Airways' success. Scraped and analyzed 2,031 customer reviews to uncover key insights on sentiment and buying behavior. Built a predictive model using Random Forest and XGBoost, achieving 85% accuracy and an AUC of 55%. Identified top five factors influencing ticket purchases: route, booking origin, flight duration, extra baggage, and length of stay


British Airways Customer Insight and Booking Behavior Analysis
This project aims to uncover customer behavior insights and predict ticket purchasing factors to enhance British Airways' data-driven decision-making process. The analysis involved two primary tasks: Customer Review Sentiment Analysis and Customer Booking Prediction, leveraging data science techniques to provide actionable recommendations.

1. Customer Review Sentiment Analysis
The objective was to analyze customer reviews to uncover insights regarding sentiments and key factors influencing satisfaction. Using a dataset of 2,031 customer reviews, the following steps were executed:

1.1. Sentiment Classification: Reviews were categorized into Positive (1,317), Neutral (3), and Negative (711) sentiments.

  Key Insights:
  
  The most frequent traveling type is Couple Leisure, while Solo Leisure received the most comfortable seat ratings.
  A strong positive correlation was identified between the likelihood of recommending British Airways and the value-for-money rating.
  Ratings below 3.5 were strongly associated with negative sentiments.
  Positive sentiments were primarily from Solo Leisure and Business Class travelers; however, these groups showed areas needing improvement.
  Clustering and Relationships:
  
  Distinct customer clusters were identified where positive sentiments aligned with high Value for Money and Seat Comfort ratings, while negative sentiments correlated with lower ratings across features.

2. Customer Booking Prediction
This phase aimed to identify factors influencing ticket purchases and build a predictive model. Using a structured dataset with booking-related attributes, the following was achieved:
  
  Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:
  
  Key attributes included Route, Booking Origin, Flight Duration, Extra Baggage, and Length of Stay.
  Model Development:
  
  An ensemble model combining Random Forest and XGBoost was trained to predict ticket purchases.
  Model Performance:
  Accuracy: 85.22%
  AUC: 0.5463
  
  Key Findings:
  
  The top 5 most influential factors in purchasing behavior were identified, offering critical insights for optimizing marketing and operational strategies.
  Conclusion
  The project successfully demonstrated the importance of leveraging customer feedback and booking data for strategic decisions. The analysis highlighted actionable areas to improve customer satisfaction, while the predictive model provided valuable insights into purchase behavior. The methodology and outcomes can guide British Airways in refining services and enhancing customer experiences.
